Cyber Coyotes's Handbook
====
Welcome to the documentation place for FRC 3603, the Cyber Coyotes. We are a small, but dedicated FRC team in central Michigan. Our aim with this documentation is to share our learning with future team members and the larger FIRST community. The original focus is on controls and programming (2023) though we may expand other areas in the future. If you found this helpful, spotted a mistake, or have a suggestion, please drop us an email CyberCoyotes AT gmail or on the `Reed City Robotics Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/groups/389845481030081/>`_ page

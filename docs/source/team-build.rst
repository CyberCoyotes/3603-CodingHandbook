We use mostly aluminum tubing for framing and arm/elevator mechanisms. Use a combindation of pre-dilled and solid sides.
We try to keep our bolt usage to 3 sizes, and have switched to using more rivets and plates for connecting tubing together. 
In 2021 we added a bench top mill, a `Markforged 3D Printer <https://markforged.com/>`_ in 2022, and a second Markforged 3D printer in late 2023.

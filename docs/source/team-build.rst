We use mostly aluminum tubing for framing and arm/elevator mechanisms. Use a combindation of pre-dilled and solid sides. We try to minimize the number of bolt sizes. For some frabrication processes we use more rivets and plates for connecting parts. 
In 2021 we added a bench top mill, a `Markforged 3D Printer <https://markforged.com/>`_ in 2022, and a second Markforged 3D printer in late 2023 which have improved built quality and capabilities significantly.

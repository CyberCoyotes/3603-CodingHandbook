We use mostly aluminum tubing some of which is predilled and others that are solid. We try to keep out bolt usage to 3 different sizes. We use a lot of rivets and plates for connecting tubing misses. We added a bench top mill (2021), a `Markforged 3D Printer <https://markforged.com/>`_. (2022) and second Markforged 3D printer (late 2023).

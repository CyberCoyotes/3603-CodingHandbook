We use mostly aluminum tubing for framing and arm/elevator mechanisms.
Use a combindation of pre-dilled and solid sides. We try to minimize the
number of bolt sizes. For some frabrication processes we use more rivets
and plates for connecting parts. In 2021 we added a bench top mill, a
[Markforged 3D Printer](https://markforged.com/) in 2022, and a second
Markforged 3D printer in late 2023 which have improved built quality and
capabilities significantly.

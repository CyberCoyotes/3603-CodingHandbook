FAQ and Getting Started with Programming
====
I've always been light on the knowledge side myself. I've learned some Java at Codecademy though I'm a science teacher, not a programmer. I can't say it's the best approach, but I've also learned FRC's Java structure by doing a lot of reverse engineering and copy-and-paste :)

VS Code has some built in examples and templates to get you started. Have you checked them out? I also posted them on our Github account so they can be viewed from a non-programming computer or Chromebook. Although the "Traditional Hatchbot" uses pneumatics, I think it is the most straight forward "outline" and the subsystem and commands can be adapted to motors by looking at the drive subsystem and drive commands.

A few questions: 
====
#. Do you have your code posted on Github?
I would highly recommend it. This will allow myself, my student programmer, or other folks to help you remotely.
#. What drivetrain are you using (mechanically)?
I would guess Differential Drive for most teams, especially younger ones.
#. What drive mode are you wanting to use? (tank vs arcade)
I would recommend Arcade
#. Have you thought about what physical game controllers (xBox, Flight joystick, etc) you have or want to use?

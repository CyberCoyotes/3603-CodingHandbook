Motion Profiling
====

When controlling a mechanism, is often desirable to move it smoothly between two positions, rather than to abruptly change its setpoint. This is called “motion-profiling,” and is supported in WPILib through the TrapezoidProfile class

For a description of the WPILib motion profiling features used by these command-based wrappers, see `Trapezoidal Motion Profiles in WPILib <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/controllers/trapezoidal-profiles.html#trapezoidal-motion-profiles-in-wpilib>`_.
Note: The TrapezoidProfile command wrappers are generally intended for composition with custom or external controllers. For combining trapezoidal motion profiling with WPILib’s PIDController, see `Combining Motion Profiling and PID in Command-Based <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/profilepid-subsystems-commands.html>`_.
To further help teams integrate motion profiling into their command-based robot projects, WPILib includes two convenience wrappers for the TrapezoidProfile class: TrapezoidProfileSubsystem, which automatically generates and executes motion profiles in its periodic() method, and the TrapezoidProfileCommand, which executes a single user-provided TrapezoidProfile.

FAQ and Getting Started with Programming
====

VS Code has some built in examples and templates to get you started. They are posted on our Github account so they can be viewed from a non-programming computers like Chromebooks or phones. Although the "Traditional Hatchbot" uses pneumatics, in my opinion it is the most straight forward "outline" and the subsystem and commands can be adapted to motors by looking at the drive subsystem and drive commands.

A few command based EXAMPLES from VS Code posted on our Cyber Coyotes Github page:
#. `Traditional Hatchbot <https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/2023-Example-TraditionalHatchbot`_.
#. `GearsBot <https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/2023-Example-GearsBot>`_.
#. `Command Robot <https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/2023-Example-CommandRobot`_.

More examples, other team examples, and tutorials can be found `here <https://cyber-coyotes-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/controls/code-examples.html`_.

A few questions when helping new teams with code: 
====
#. Are you using a Timed Robot or Command Based code setup?
We use command based, but many teams starting out find it easier to used Timed because almost all of the coding is done in one file (Robot.java)
#. What drivetrain are you using (mechanically)?
I would guess Differential Drive for most teams, especially younger ones.
#. What drive mode are you wanting to use? (tank vs arcade)
Personal preference, but we recommend Arcade
#. Have you thought about what physical game controllers (xBox, Flight joystick, etc) you have or want to use?
Again, personal preference.
#. Do you have your code posted on Github?
Highly recommended. This will allow our team or other folks to view your code and offer assistance from affar. See the `Github tutorial <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world>`_ for help getting started.

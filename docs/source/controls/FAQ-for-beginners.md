  FAQ and Getting Started with Programming
  ------------------------------------------

VS Code has some built in examples and templates to get you started. We
have uploaded some of the Timed Robot examples and Command Robot
examples to out Github page and compliled a list of other teams\' code
[here
\<https://cyber-coyotes-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/controls/code-examples.html]().
The FRC community is very good about helping each other.

A few questions when helping new teams with code: ==== #. Are you using
a Timed Robot or Command Based code setup? We use command based, but
many teams starting out find it easier to used Timed because almost all
of the coding is done in one file (Robot.java) #. What drivetrain are
you using (mechanically)? I would guess Differential Drive for most
teams, especially younger ones. #. What drive mode are you wanting to
use? (tank vs arcade) Personal preference, but we recommend Arcade #.
Have you thought about what physical game controllers (xBox, Flight
joystick, etc) you have or want to use? Again, personal preference. #.
Do you have your code posted on Github? Highly recommended. This will
allow our team or other folks to view your code and offer assistance
from affar. See the [Github
tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)
for help getting started.

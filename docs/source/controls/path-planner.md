# PathPlanner

\"PathPlanner is a motion profile generator for FRC robots created by
team 3015.\"

It is available from the [github
repo](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner) and in the Microsoft
Store. The [wiki](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/wiki) is
kept up to date so I would check there for instructions and Chief Delphi
for tips & clarifications.

You must install
[PathPlannerLib](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/wiki/PathPlannerLib:-Installing)
to generate your paths.

`https://3015rangerrobotics.github.io/pathplannerlib/PathplannerLib.json`

Just need the latest
[release](https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/releases)?

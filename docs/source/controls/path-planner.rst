PathPlanner
============

"PathPlanner is a motion profile generator for FRC robots created by team 3015." 

It is available from the `github repo <https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner>`_ and in the Microsoft Store. The `wiki <https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/wiki>`_ is kept up to date so I would check there for instructions and Chief Delphi for tips & clarifications.

You must install `PathPlannerLib <https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/wiki/PathPlannerLib:-Installing>`_ to generate your paths.

Just need the latest `release <https://github.com/mjansen4857/pathplanner/releases>`_?

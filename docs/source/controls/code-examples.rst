Timed Robot EXAMPLES from VS Code
----
#. [Tank  Drive (Timed Robot)](https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/Example-TankDrive)
#. [Arcade Drive](https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/Example-ArcadeDrive)
#. [Pneumatics](https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/Example-ArcadeDrive)


Command Based EXAMPLES from VS Code
----
#. `Traditional Hatchbot <https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/2023-Example-TraditionalHatchbot`_. Although the "Traditional Hatchbot" uses pneumatics, in my opinion it is the most straight forward "outline" and the subsystem and commands can be adapted to motors by looking at the drive subsystem and drive commands.

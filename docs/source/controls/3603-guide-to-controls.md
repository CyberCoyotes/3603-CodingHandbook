## Getting Started with Java Resources for New FRC Programmers {#getting-started-with-java-resources-for-new-frc-programmers}

You can always start with the official [WPILib Documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/). I found it confusing years ago; too much information and too many "snippets" that never got cleaned up or explained properly. It's improved greatly over the years, but we thought we would put something together to help teams get started as there are many things NOT covered by WPILib docs.

###

### Important Tips for Beginners {#important-tips-for-beginners}

1. Start Simple

   - Begin with basic Java syntax

   - Move to FRC-specific concepts only after understanding basics

   - Don't try to understand everything at once

2. Practice Regularly

   - Write code daily, even if just for 30 minutes

   - Start with simple programs

   - Gradually increase complexity

3. Use Debug Tools

   - Learn to use VS Code debugger

   - Practice reading error messages

   - Use System.out.println() for debugging

4. Read Other Teams' Code

   - Study code from successful teams

   - Learn different approaches to similar problems

   - Don't just copy \- understand why things are done certain ways

### Github and Git {#github-and-git}

Github and Git are NOT requirements for Java or other programming in FRC, but they can be incredibly helpful. Git is like a time machine for your code and documents. Imagine you're writing a story, and every time you make significant changes, you want to save a snapshot of your work. Git does exactly that for programming projects (though it can be used for any type of files). It keeps track of every change you make, letting you:

* Save different versions of your work

* Go back to earlier versions if something goes wrong

* Work on different versions simultaneously (like having a "draft" and a "final" version)

* See what changed between versions, when it changed, and who changed it

GitHub, on the other hand, is like a social network for Git projects. It's a website where you can:

* Store your Git projects online (like storing your documents in Google Drive)

* Share your work with others

* Collaborate with other people on the same project

* Find and use code that other people have shared

* Track issues and manage projects

The main terms you'll hear:

* Repository (or "repo"): Your project folder and all its history

* Commit: A snapshot of your changes

* Branch: A separate version of your project (like a draft chapter of your story)

* Push: Uploading your changes to GitHub

* Pull: Downloading changes from GitHub

* Clone: Making a copy of a project to work on

## *Learn how to create a public repository at Github, post your code and ask other teams to help you with your code if you get stuck\!*

[Learn Git | Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) is helpful for concepts, but you DO NOT have to learn the command line for Git. Use the Github Desktop client to commit, push, and pull code.

## Software Installation & Setup {#software-installation-&-setup}

Every season requires updates to both your computer software and robot code. This guide covers essential software updates for the FRC season that we, FRC 3603, use each season.

### Recommended Workflow {#recommended-workflow}

1. Start with primary installations

2. Install the secondary installations

3. Update motor and controller firmware

4. Install additional software tools as needed

5. Verify all installations and updates

6. Check for updates throughout the season\!

### Primary Installations {#primary-installations}

These are absolutely needed for every team

| Must be downloaded annually after the game's release each January. Links will be updated then.  |

### Vendor Dependencies {#vendor-dependencies}

After setting up a new code project each season, you need to (re)add any vendor dependencies a.k.a. Vendor Deps. Robot component manufacturers will often have specialized code libraries to use or enhance the use of their hardware. To use them you have to add their vendor deps. Here are some of the more common vendors.

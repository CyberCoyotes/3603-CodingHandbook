Timed Robot EXAMPLES from VS Code \-\-\--#. [Tank Drive (Timed
Robot)](https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/Example-TankDrive) #. [Arcade
Drive (Timed
Robot)](https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/Example-ArcadeDrive) #.
[Pneumatics (Timed
Robot)](https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/Example-Pneumatics)

Command Based EXAMPLES from VS Code \-\-\--#. [Traditional
Hatchbot](https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/2023-Example-TraditionalHatchbot).
Although the \"Traditional Hatchbot\" uses pneumatics, in my opinion it
is the most straight forward \"outline\" and the subsystem and commands
can be adapted to motors by looking at the drive subsystem and drive
commands. #. [Gears

Robot \<https://github.com/CyberCoyotes/2023-Example-CommandRobot]().

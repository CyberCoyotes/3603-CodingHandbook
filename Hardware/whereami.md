# Welcome!

This is where hardware will be described, focused mainly on the actually useful bits. The focus of this section will be on the perks and quirks of each device covered, reducing ChiefDelphi prowling to a minimum. Code and principles should hopefully be seperated, so that theory and code can be understood independently.

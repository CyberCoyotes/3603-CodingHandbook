Issue 06: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD YOU NEED TO SET PID VALUES. JUST DO <br> `m_motorController.config_kP(0,1); m_motorController.config_kI(0,0); m_motorController.config_kD(0,0); m_motorController.selectProfileSlot(0, 0);` <br> PLEASE. I SPENT SO LONG ON THIS. WAS THE ISSUE AUTON? `"No."` HOW ABOUT THE VALUE SUPPLIED? `"Not today, man."` MAYBE I GOTTA GET RID OF THE DIGITAL LIMITS? `"Back off, kid."` LIKE WHAT?!?!?! IT WAS THAT SIMPLE?? WHO DID I THINK I WAS??????? <br> btw this was all on a TalonSRX

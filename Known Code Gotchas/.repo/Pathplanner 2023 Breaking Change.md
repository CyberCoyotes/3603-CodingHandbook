Issue 01: Pathplanner, in versions beyond 2022.2.1(unverified), do not support ProfiledPIDControllers as arguments to a PPSwerveControllerCommand for the thetaPIDController, for unknown reasons. This issue has appeared in trying to use UrsulineBearbotics own vendor dependency, along with making our own pathplanner commands. The only solution WAS to downdate to 22.2.1 by modifying the JSON file, but that has resulted in Issue 04. Simply not using a profile for the rotation at all seems to be the solution.

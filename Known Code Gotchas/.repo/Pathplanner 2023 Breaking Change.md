Issue 01: Pathplanner, in versions beyond 2022.2.1(unverified), do not support ProfiledPIDControllers as arguments to a PPSwerveControllerCommand for the thetaPIDController, for unknown reasons. This issue has appeared in trying to use UrsulineBearbotics own vendor dependency, along with making our own pathplanner commands. The only solution so far is to just downdate to 22.2.1 by modifying the JSON file.

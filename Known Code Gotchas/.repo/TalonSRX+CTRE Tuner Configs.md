Issue 05: The Talon SRX being a pain to configure virtual soft limits for. Here is an overview of configuring these configs: 

## Setting up virtual limits
. . .
## Tuner being a pain
Phoenix tuner can be a good starting option for testing, but should not be relied upon for consistent code settings, and has even struggled to test properly, or has done so when configuring soft limits. Actually setting up the SRX is simple; Power off, hold the button on the controller, and turn on, releasing when green lights flash on the controller; detailed instructions online. This will reset the controller, allowing you to set configs in code, which have shown much more consitent performace.

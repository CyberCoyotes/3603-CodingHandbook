# COMMAND BASED
##
There are two approaches to making an FRC robot: **iterative**, and **Command-Based**, of which we use the latter.
<br/>

# iterative
iterative is like designing a linear list of orders for the robot to follow.
It's hard to properly communicate the differences between the two philopsophies in a tl;dr format, but the cliff notes are that iterative is what most inexperienced people would default to. While it's easier in the very short term, the drawbacks are too large to be viable; added maintenience, dependency, and ambiguity in control flow are all reasons to avoid iterative.


# Command Based (and declarative)
Command based is like designing a set of rules for the robot to follow.
A quick distinction is in order:
"Command-Based" refers to the way robot properties and actions are broken into **subsystems** and **commands**, with a large arsenal of classes and functions to help with the subsystems and commands. "Declarative" programming is the more sustainable, effective method of programming that goes with command-based like PB+J. For this reason, they will often be grouped together as simply "Command-Based" (occasionally, "sane, functional human being code")

    <td>Fine for short snippets of code, <br>but complex systems and developers will suffer greatly from the inherent <br>lack of clarity</td>
    <td>Easier to separate each function call and class into individual parts, <br>and debugging can be made much easier (if you're smart)</td>

    <td>Issuing Robot Orders</td>
    <td>Calling robot methods directly; easy to understand for a whole 5 seconds,<br>dependencies will FESTER</td>

If you yet hunger for perfection beyond Declarative, check out the SOLID principles, one of the most popular set of guidelines for clean code out there. I would recommend watching Tim Corey's videos on the priciples. They're boring as *redacted*, but they are presented carefully enough to actually teach. Another caveat is that he uses C#, which won't matter too much, as the principles are universal once you understand them, and C# and Java are fairly similar in basic syntax.

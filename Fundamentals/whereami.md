# Where am I?
##
This is the <b>fundamentals</b> tab of the very much in progress handbook for 3603. 
<br>
Here, you will find the mostly theoretical aspects of robot programming, including:
<ul>
<li>Command based programming (advantages over imperative, how to not write horrific spaghetti code)</li>
<li>File organization</li>
<li>Conceptual goals and understandings (and how we program them)</li>
<li>~~cool keyboard shortcuts~~</li>
<li>~~buzzwords to make you sound smart~~</li>
</ul>
<b>Basically, this is where you should start when approaching new material, rather than jumping straight into the scary code.</b>
